# Overall
It seems that most things have worked much better this time around, which I am glad for. Everything from code structure to working with git (within limits) and working together seems to have been smoother. The end application is good enough for a hotel management system, but I am sure that your way of making bookings might be a bit cumbersome in the long run with many guests. But it works fine here and now.

# Code
The quality of the code is quite good. You have mostly divided it into logical MVC parts and for most parts the code is commented in a good way. It is easy to navigate through your code.

# Presentation and Team Work
As always, presentations that are recoded like this suffer a bit, but I think you did okay. It also seems like, for the most parts, team work did work.

# Grade
The group is given a C as overall grade.
