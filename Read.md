**Introduction**

This readme will refelct on what we have done and problems we faced during the project

**The meetings**

We had recorded meetings at the end of every sprint, we had some difficulities in getting the members to the meetings since some of them were abroad, because of that there were inconsistencies in the length of every sprint.

**Work flow**

We let each member choose the issue they liked to work on, then after each meeting we decide on the division of the issues.

In each sprint we split the members into frontend and backend.

**contribution**

A difference between memebers in contribution can be noticed, this was because of personal circumstances, the rest of the group worked towards to holding and solving these problems as group in the best way possible.
in the last few commits were in the name of Edmunds because he faced issues with vs code.
at the end it was a good experience for us to work as group.
